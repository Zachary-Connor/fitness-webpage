                <h1>Why Working Out Matters</h1>
                <h2>Purpose Of This Website</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this website is to show you that working out can benefit for you-regardless your age, background, or experience.
                    My name is Zach, and I am a certified personal trainer with nearly two years of experience working with clients. Besides my certification, I was a collegiate
                    athlete who has been through the process myself. I have worked with many coaches and trainers over the years who have guided me. I want to bring the same kind
                    of practical experience they offered me to you! If you are struggling to think of how working out will benefit you, here is a list of benefits:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Reduce your risk of injury</li>
                    <li>Reduce your joint pain</li>
                    <li>Improve the quality of your movements </li>
                    <li>Improve your physical appearance</li>
                    <li>Improve your strength</li>
                    <li>Improve your endurance</li>
                    <li>Improve your mood</li>
                    <li>Help you manage stress</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The list can go on and on, but these are the ones at the top of my list. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in America,
                    so being able to reduce your chances of being affected is huge! So now you have some good reasons and starting points when it comes to working out.

                <br>
                <p>
                    When it comes to fitness and you lack experience it can be overwhelming. I understand. I didn't enjoy working out at first. In high school, I often questioned if
                    I was doing the right exercises the right way. The goal of this section is to introduce the major aspects of health and fitness which are
                    resistance training, cardiovascular training, stretching, and nutrition. The other sections you see in the navigation bar go more in depth about how your body functions
                    and how I structure workouts based upon your goals and experience. I recommend you click on the links in the navigation bar to learn more about each subject. To get a
                    general overview of what fitness includes, click the <a href="./fitness_intro.html">Fitness Introduction</a> link. See you soon!
